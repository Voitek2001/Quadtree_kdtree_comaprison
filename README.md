# Quadtree Kdtree comparison - project for Geometrical Algorithms
### 2022/23 winter semester, Computer Science WIEiT AGH UST

Welcome to the Quad Tree vs. KD Tree project, where we delve into the world of spatial data structures and explore the strengths and weaknesses of two widely used tree-based data structures: the Quad Tree and the KD Tree. This project aims to provide a comprehensive comparison between these data structures to help developers and researchers choose the most suitable one for their specific use cases.

Quad Tree and KD Tree are popular data structures for organizing and efficiently querying multidimensional data points in various applications, including computer graphics, geographic information systems (GIS), nearest neighbor searches, and more. Each structure has its unique properties and is optimized for specific scenarios, making it crucial to understand their differences and trade-offs.

There is also extensive project documentation available in Polish.
